            fashionable style of dressing that fits right on body and
            made for all seasons. From a young kid design of clothing was in out hearts and in high school started
            making
            and selling styles and designs made with our unique touch. Now that we have expanded and acquired more
            resources
            we are happy to move forward and keep providing the world with our style.

        <h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>

        <p> From our beginnings we work hard and hope wew do two things: share great design and help make the world a better place with our fashion.
            We are from the small town of Virginia Beach, Virginia. We started with a small circle of friends in high school 
            but we have grown to be a big family once we form the dream company of ours simpleshop company. 
            Our beginnings were rough since we were young when we started this passion of ours but through the years we have
            become strong and learn along the way to become the strong family we are today. 
            We have accomplish a lot of ours goals from our small beginnings but the main accomplishment we have achieved is 
            being to showcase out designs on the big four Milan, Paris, New York, London.
            <br>
            Our mission is to inspire the creativity in every human one design at a time.</p>
